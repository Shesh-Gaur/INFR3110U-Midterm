Even - Programmer

Notes:
Any new files I added/created for this midterm are included in the "MidtermStuff" folder in Unity.
For Q3, I made MusicManager with an audio source, and added to the Coin script to call the MusicManager's functions.

Credits:
- I used the Unity Project From Lab Week 3 as a Foundation for this project.
- Models from: https://quaternius.com/packs/ultimateplatformer.html 
- Used my own music
